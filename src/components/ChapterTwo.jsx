          Chapter II. Proletarians and Communists
        </h2>

        <p>In what relation do the Communists stand to the proletarians as a whole?</p>

        <p>The Communists do not form a separate party opposed to the other working-class parties.</p>

        <p>They have no interests separate and apart from those of the proletariat as a whole.</p>

        <p>They do not set up any sectarian principles of their own, by which to shape and mould the proletarian movement.</p>

        <p>The Communists are distinguished from the other working-class parties by this only: 1. In the national struggles of the proletarians of the different countries, they point out and bring to the front the common interests of the entire proletariat, independently of all nationality. 2. In the various stages of development which the struggle of the working class against the bourgeoisie has to pass through, they always and everywhere represent the interests of the movement as a whole.</p>

        <p>The Communists, therefore, are on the one hand, practically, the most advanced and resolute section of the working-class parties of every country, that section which pushes forward all others; on the other hand, theoretically, they have over the great mass of the proletariat the advantage of clearly understanding the line of march, the conditions, and the ultimate general results of the proletarian movement.</p>

        <p>The immediate aim of the Communists is the same as that of all other proletarian parties: formation of the proletariat into a class, overthrow of the bourgeois supremacy, conquest of political power by the proletariat. </p>

      </div>

      <div className='topbox'>
        <p>But let us have done with the bourgeois objections to Communism.</p>

        <p>We have seen above, that the first step in the revolution by the working class is to raise the proletariat to the position of ruling class to win the battle of democracy.</p>

        <p>The proletariat will use its political supremacy to wrest, by degrees, all capital from the bourgeoisie, to centralise all instruments of production in the hands of the State, i.e., of the proletariat organised as the ruling class; and to increase the total of productive forces as rapidly as possible.</p>

        <p>Of course, in the beginning, this cannot be effected except by means of despotic inroads on the rights of property, and on the conditions of bourgeois production; by means of measures, therefore, which appear economically insufficient and untenable, but which, in the course of the movement, outstrip themselves, necessitate further inroads upon the old social order, and are unavoidable as a means of entirely revolutionising the mode of production.</p>

        <p>These measures will, of course, be different in different countries.</p>

        <p>Nevertheless, in most advanced countries, the following will be pretty generally applicable.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>1. Abolition of property in land and application of all rents of land to public purposes.</li>
          <li>2. A heavy progressive or graduated income tax.</li>
          <li>3. Abolition of all rights of inheritance.</li>
          <li>4. Confiscation of the property of all emigrants and rebels.</li>
          <li>5. Centralisation of credit in the hands of the state, by means of a national bank with State capital and an exclusive monopoly.</li>
          <li>6. Centralisation of the means of communication and transport in the hands of the State.</li>
          <li>7. Extension of factories and instruments of production owned by the State; the bringing into cultivation of waste-lands, and the improvement of the soil generally in accordance with a common plan.</li>
          <li>8. Equal liability of all to work. Establishment of industrial armies, especially for agriculture.</li>
          <li>9. Combination of agriculture with manufacturing industries; gradual abolition of all the distinction between town and country by a more equable distribution of the populace over the country.</li>
          <li>10. Free education for all children in public schools. Abolition of childrenâ€™s factory labour in its present form. Combination of education with industrial production, &c, &c. </li>
        </ul>
