          A spectre is haunting Europe â€” the spectre of communism. All the powers of old Europe have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this spectre: Pope and Tsar, Metternich and Guizot, French Radicals and German police-spies.
        </h2>

        <p>Where is the party in opposition that has not been decried as communistic by its opponents in power? Where is the opposition that has not hurled back the branding reproach of communism, against the more advanced opposition parties, as well as against its reactionary adversaries?</p>

        <p>Two things result from this fact:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>I. Communism is already acknowledged by all European powers to be itself a power.</li>
          <li>II. It is high time that Communists should openly, in the face of the whole world, publish their views, their aims, their tendencies, and meet this nursery tale of the Spectre of Communism with a manifesto of the party itself. </li>

          Chapter II. Proletarians and Communists
        </h2>

        <p>In what relation do the Communists stand to the proletarians as a whole?</p>

        <p>The Communists do not form a separate party opposed to the other working-class parties.</p>

        <p>They have no interests separate and apart from those of the proletariat as a whole.</p>

        <p>They do not set up any sectarian principles of their own, by which to shape and mould the proletarian movement.</p>

        <p>The Communists are distinguished from the other working-class parties by this only: 1. In the national struggles of the proletarians of the different countries, they point out and bring to the front the common interests of the entire proletariat, independently of all nationality. 2. In the various stages of development which the struggle of the working class against the bourgeoisie has to pass through, they always and everywhere represent the interests of the movement as a whole.</p>

        <p>The Communists, therefore, are on the one hand, practically, the most advanced and resolute section of the working-class parties of every country, that section which pushes forward all others; on the other hand, theoretically, they have over the great mass of the proletariat the advantage of clearly understanding the line of march, the conditions, and the ultimate general results of the proletarian movement.</p>

        <p>The immediate aim of the Communists is the same as that of all other proletarian parties: formation of the proletariat into a class, overthrow of the bourgeois supremacy, conquest of political power by the proletariat. </p>
